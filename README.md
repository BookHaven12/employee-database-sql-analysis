# SQL Employee Database Analysis

## Overview  
This project demonstrates my SQL skills in **database design**, **data import**, and **query optimization**. I created a relational database from CSV files, designed an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), and wrote complex queries to extract meaningful insights from employee and department data.

## Tools & Skills Used  
- PostgreSQL  
- SQL (joins, aggregation, filtering, subqueries)  
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) design  
- Data import from CSV  
- Relational database design

## Key Tasks  
- Created and normalized tables based on CSV files  
- Designed a clear ERD to structure employee-department relationships  
- Wrote queries to analyze salary trends, department structures, and employee roles  
- Optimized queries for readability and performance

## Collaboration  
Special thanks to **Brian Perry** for providing guidance on the ERD structure during office hours.
